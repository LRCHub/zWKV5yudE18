Playing in the morning
As you may need a reminding
Where I am
And if it's morning
It must be morning

Hear it in the morning
As you may care to pretend
That I'm downstairs
And if it's morning
It must be morning

I'm flying to coast
And I'm going to see my best friend
For he is going to marry his
Very very best friend
And when I get back
We'll start an acid rock band
But anyone can do the band thing now, man

To hear it in the morning
As you may need a reminder
What's downstairs
It's morning...
