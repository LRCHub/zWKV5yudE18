Hey brother
Happy returns
It's been a while now
I bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm still here
Nothing's changed
Nothing's changed
Hey brother
I'd love to tell you I've been busy
But that would be a lie
'Cause the truth is
The years just pass like trains
I wave but they don't slow down
They don't slow down
Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh

Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh-lara-la
Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh

Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh-lara-la
Hey brother
I see the freaks and dispossessed on day release
Avoiding the police
I feel I'm falling once again
But now there's no one left to catch me
Hey brother
I feel I'm living in parentheses
And I got trouble with the bills
Do the kids remember me?
Well I got gifts for them
And for you more sorrow
But I'm feeling kind of drowsy now
So I'll finish this tomorrow
Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh
Lara-la
Lara-lara-la
Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh-lara-la
Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh
Lara-la
Lara-lara-la
Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh-lara-la
Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh
Lara-la
Lara-lara-la
Doo-doo-doo-doo-uh-lara-la
