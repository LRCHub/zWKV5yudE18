The silence is broken by somebody crying
Trying to be heard, never a word
Always the attitude
Sort out your own, always alone
Wishing for something the world is denying
Out in the wilderness, somebody's crying

Somebody wishing for something to happen
Wishing to tell, wishing to hell
Someone was listening
Someone who cared, never despaired
Someone to lean on and someone to trust
Who needs your assistance, and finds your disgust

Something that you have the power to give
To give or to take, to make or to break
The innocent spirit of somebody's hope, assistance to cope
The water that heals or the fire that burns
Out in the wilderness, silence returns
